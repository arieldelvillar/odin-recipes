    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>450g Bread flour</li>
        <li>80g Lard, butter, or vegtable oil</li>
        <li>5g Kosher salt</li>
        <li>250ml warm water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the flour to a bowl and rub in the lard (or butter) using your finger tips until broken up.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the salt in the warm water. Gradually add the water and mix it into the flour mixture to see how much it will absorb.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough onto a flat surface and work into a cohesive dough with your hands for about 5 minutes. At the end, the dough should be fairly smooth and not sticking to your hands.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 10 pieces (for a medium burrito size) by weighing them out on a scale (about 80 g). Roll them into very smooth small balls with your hands. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 20 minutes or up to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat a large griddle or cast iron pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Flatten the tortilla ball and roll out to your desired thinness.</li>
        <li>Lay the tortilla on the hot griddle and cook for 10-20 seconds, then flip to the other side to cook for another 10-20 seconds. The tortillas should be lightly browned in spots. Be careful not to overcook the tortilla or else they will become hard instead of soft and pliable.</li>
        <li>Immediately, stack the tortillas in a large cloth or clean kitchen towel until you are ready for serving.</li>
    </ol>
